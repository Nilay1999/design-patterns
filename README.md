# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains examples and explanations of various **design patterns** in software development. Each design pattern is implemented in **TypeScript** and stored in its respective folder under the `src/` directory.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems in software design. They are templates for solving specific design issues and help developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Design patterns are categorized into three main groups:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and structure.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with object interaction and responsibility.

## Design Patterns in This Repository

This repository includes the following design patterns:

### 1. [Adapter Pattern](/src/Adapter/)

The **Adapter Pattern** allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another that the client expects.

### 2. [Builder Pattern](/src/Builder/)

The **Builder Pattern** separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### 3. [Decorator Pattern](/src/Decorator/)

The **Decorator Pattern** allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

### 4. [Facade Pattern](/src/Facade/)

The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexity from the client.

### 5. [Factory Method Pattern](/src/FactoryMethod/)

The **Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
